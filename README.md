# Typescript-learning
One of my âœ¨2022âœ¨ New Year resolutions is to master TypeScript!ðŸ’ª This repository is personal notes to learn TS and also enhance Javascript skills.

# What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

# Why should I learn TS?
ðŸ’¡ TypeScript is not a brand new computer language. It takes Javascript language and **add new features and advantages to it.** <br />
It makes writing JS code easier and more powerful during development. Itâ€™s a language but also **a tool**, **a powerful compiler** which you run over your code to compile your TS code to JS. easier syntax and It adds *â€˜typesâ€™* which gives us extra error checking.
BUT it canâ€™t be executed by JS environment(like browser, nodeJS). a browser canâ€™t execute TypeScript!
